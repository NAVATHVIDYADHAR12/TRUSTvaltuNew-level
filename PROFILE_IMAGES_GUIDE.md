## Current Status

The images are now using **placehold.co** service with colored backgrounds and initials.

To use the actual AI-generated images:

1. The images are available in the chat as artifacts
2. Save them to: `public/images/profiles/`
3. Update the image paths in `app/search/page.tsx`

## Alternative: Use Better Placeholder Service

For now, I recommend using **DiceBear Avatars** which generates nice looking avatars on-the-fly:

- Company logos: https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/initials/svg?seed=CompanyName
- People: https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/avataaars/svg?seed=PersonName

This provides much better looking images than simple colored squares!
